# OnPoint Document Hub

This GitHub Pages site publishes two lightweight reference guides for the OnPoint program:

- `index.md` — **OnPoint One Document**: strategic overview with five high-level fields.
- `operation.md` — **OnPoint Operation Document**: operational readiness checklist with five supporting fields.

Both pages inherit the default Jekyll theme and include shared styling for a clean table-based presentation. Update the tables directly in their respective markdown files to keep the documentation current.
