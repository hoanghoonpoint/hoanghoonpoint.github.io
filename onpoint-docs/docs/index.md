# Welcome to OnPoint's OLAP Documentation

This documentation covers data tables, schema, and BI usage.

OLAP stands for Online Analytical Processing. An OLAP system not only provides default templates for different departments to use, but it’s also considered a self-serve analytics system where anyone can answer their own questions based on the available dataset.

Example:

With the default template, you can see the OnPoint NMV. When you want to dig deeper such as which CD the NMV comes from, which brand, which product, which source, or which KOL—the system can answer these questions through a few drag-and-drop actions using the corresponding dimensions and metrics.

We use the concept of a cube, which contains various information such as dimensions and metrics.

For example, for an order, the order_id is a dimension, and the value of the order is a metric.

The data team has released a system called OLAP, which includes several datasets related to different departments as follows:
